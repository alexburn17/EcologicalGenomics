# January 23, 2017: 

## Info Update:

* Advantages in Seq tech. 

* Ranage of applications:   

          - WGS (whole genome sequencing)   
          - RNAseq (seqencing RNA conveted to cDNA)    
          - Targeted caputure seq. (string of probes mixed with sample, pulls immune related genes from organisim and seq just those)    
          - Chipseq (chromatin imunoprecipitation seq, recognizezes and antibody and puls out all DNA bound to that portein)     
          
**Why one or the other?**

Genetic variation   

      -phenotypes
      
number of samples   

      -population   
      -individual   
      -comparitive studies   
      -model or not  
      
Demographic history

gene expression car.

length of reads

number of reads

distribution


Reads:

      - short = 50bp
      - long 100 bp, 150 bp, 300 bp (miseq)
      - 10,000-60,000bp = SMRT

Single vs. paired end

* General library Prep. Workflow   

* Sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS)   

* Other Technologies   

* Learning Activity   


**Human Genome Project (2001-2003)**

-ABI - Sanger   
-15 years   
-1 geneome (one person)   
-$3 billion   

Uses PCR and sequences broken by faulty base pairs to work backwards

**2014 X-Ten releases**

-Hiseq by Illumina (look up video of how it works)  
-1 day    
-45 whole genomes    
-$1000 bucks each
